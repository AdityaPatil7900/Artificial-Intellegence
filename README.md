# INTRODUCTION
With the rise of SMS and messaging apps, spam messages have become a major concern, leading to fraud and clutter. This project aims to build an NLP-based machine learning model to classify SMS as Spam or Ham, using text preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms for efficient spam detection.
